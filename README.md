pyTerrainGen
============

2D terrain generator in Python

The script will generate a pseudorandom terrain, and show it in a tkinter window.

Eventually the terrain will be scrollable and it may be turned into a side-scrolling minigame, although this may be unfeasible to the slowness of the methods used.
